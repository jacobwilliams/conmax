! WELCOME TO CONMAX, VERSION 1.7
!
! THIS PACKAGE WAS LAST REVISED ON DECEMBER 4, 1996.
!
! SUCCESS STORIES AND BUG REPORTS MAY BE SENT TO EDWIN H. KAUFMAN, JR.
! BY E-MAIL AT  32ZEJ7N@CMUVM.CSV.CMICH.EDU
! ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT PROMISE TO ATTEMPT TO FIX BUGS, WE MAY LOOK AT
! THEM AS TIME PERMITS.
!
! THIS PACKAGE CONSISTS OF THREE PARTS:
!
! (I) THE USERS GUIDE YOU ARE READING,
!
! (II) A SAMPLE DRIVER PROGRAM AND SUBROUTINE FNSET, AND
!
! (III) THE CONMAX SUBPROGRAMS.
!
! THIS PACKAGE IS SELF-CONTAINED.  ONCE THE USER HAS SET (ONCE) THE
! THREE MACHINE DEPENDENT CONSTANTS AND THE PRECISION AS DESCRIBED IN (A)
! BELOW, THE PACKAGE CAN BE COMPILED AND EXECUTED TO RUN THE EXAMPLE IN
! THE SAMPLE DRIVER PROGRAM AND SUBROUTINE FNSET.  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS
! FOR APPLYING THE PROGRAM TO OTHER PROBLEMS ARE GIVEN IN THIS USERS GUIDE.
!
! CONMAX CONSISTS OF TWO PROGRAMS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM
!
!     MINIMIZE W
!
!     SUBJECT TO
!
!     ABS(FUN(I) - CONFUN(I,1)) .LE. W      IF ICNTYP(I)=2,
!
!     CONFUN(I,1)               .LE. W      IF ICNTYP(I)=1,
!
!     CONFUN(I,1)               .LE. 0.0    IF ICNTYP(I)=-1 OR -2,
!
! WHERE IF ICNTYP(I)=-1 THE CONSTRAINT IS LINEAR (I.E. THE LEFT SIDE
! CONSISTS OF A LINEAR COMBINATION OF THE PARAMETERS IN THE VECTOR ARRAY
! PARAM PLUS A CONSTANT) AND IF ICNTYP(I)=-2 THE CONSTRAINT MAY BE
! NONLINEAR.
!
! THUS WE ARE CHOOSING THE PARAMETERS TO MINIMIZE THE LEFT SIDES OF
! THE TYPE 2 AND TYPE 1 (I.E. PRIMARY) CONSTRAINTS SUBJECT TO THE
! TYPE -1 AND TYPE -2 (I.E. STANDARD) CONSTRAINTS.
!
! IF THERE ARE NO PRIMARY CONSTRAINTS THE PROGRAM WILL ATTEMPT TO
! FIND A FEASIBLE POINT (THAT IS, A VECTOR PARAM FOR WHICH THE TYPE -1
! AND TYPE -2 CONSTRAINTS ARE SATISFIED WITHIN A TOLERANCE TOLCON
! DESCRIBED BELOW) WHICH IS RELATIVELY CLOSE TO THE USER SUPPLIED INITIAL
! APPROXIMATION, THEN RETURN.
!
! (WE NOTE HERE THAT THE ONLY ACTIVE WRITE STATEMENTS IN THIS PACKAGE
! ARE IN THE SAMPLE DRIVER PROGRAM, BUT SOME OF THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN
! COMMENTED OUT (ALONG WITH THE STATEMENTS  NWRIT=output_unit) ELSEWHERE
! IN THE PROGRAM COULD PROVE USEFUL, ESPECIALLY THE STATEMENT
! WRITE(NWRIT,1100)... IN SUBROUTINE CONMAX.)
!
! TO USE THE PACKAGE THE USER MUST DO TWO THINGS:
!
! (1)  CREATE A DRIVER (I.E. MAIN) PROGRAM WHICH DIMENSIONS THE ARRAYS
! FUN, PTTBL, IWORK, WORK, PARAM, AND ERROR, SETS THE INPUT VARIABLES
! IOPTN, NPARM, NUMGR, ITLIM, IFUN, IPTB, INDM, LIWRK, LWRK, PARAM
! (AND POSSIBLY ALSO FUN AND PTTBL), CONTAINS THE STATEMENT
!
!     CALL CONMAX(IOPTN,NPARM,NUMGR,ITLIM,FUN,IFUN,PTTBL,IPTB,
!    *INDM,IWORK,LIWRK,WORK,LWRK,ITER,PARAM,ERROR)
!
! AND PRINTS THE OUTPUT.  IN ADDITION, WITH CERTAIN SETTINGS OF IOPTN
! (SEE BELOW) THE USER WILL ALSO SUPPLY INPUT VALUES IN IWORK(1) AND
! WORK(1), AND/OR IWORK(2), AND/OR WORK(2);  SINCE IWORK AND WORK ARE
! CHANGED BY THE PROGRAM, IN THIS CASE THE USER WILL NEED TO RESET THESE
! VALUES EACH TIME CONMAX IS CALLED.
!
! (2)  CREATE A SUBROUTINE FNSET (DESCRIBED LATER) FOR INPUT OF FUNCTION
! DATA AND THE VECTOR ARRAY ICNTYP, WHICH SPECIFIES THE TYPE OF THE
! CONSTRAINTS.
!
! THE VARIABLES IN THE CALLING SEQUENCE FOR CONMAX ARE THE FOLLOWING.
!
! IOPTN  (INPUT)  THIS IS THE OPTION SWITCH, WHICH SHOULD BE SET TO
!        0 UNLESS ONE OR MORE OF THE EXTRA OPTIONS DESCRIBED BELOW
!        IS USED.
!
! NPARM  (INPUT)  THIS IS THE NUMBER OF PARAMETERS IN THE PROBLEM.
!        (THEY ARE STORED IN PARAM--SEE BELOW.)
!
! NUMGR  (INPUT)  THIS IS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CONSTRAINTS.
!
! ITLIM  (INPUT)  THIS IS THE LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF ITERATIONS, I.E.
!        THE LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE PROGRAM REDUCES W.  IF
!        ITLIM IS SET TO 0 THE PROGRAM WILL COMPUTE THE ERRORS FOR
!        THE INITIAL APPROXIMATION AND STOP WITHOUT CHECKING
!        FEASIBILITY.
!
! FUN    (OPTIONAL INPUT)  (VECTOR ARRAY OF DIMENSION IFUN)  THIS IS
!        A VECTOR ARRAY IN WHICH DATA OR FUNCTION VALUES IN TYPE 2
!        CONSTRAINTS (SEE ABOVE) CAN BE STORED.  FUN(I) NEED NOT BE
!        ASSIGNED A VALUE IF IT IS NOT GOING TO BE USED.
!
! IFUN   (INPUT)  THIS IS THE DIMENSION OF FUN IN THE DRIVER PROGRAM.
!        IT MUST BE .GE. THE LARGEST INDEX I FOR WHICH FUN(I) IS USED
!        UNLESS NO FUN(I) IS USED, IN WHICH CASE IT MUST BE .GE. 1.
!
! PTTBL  (OPTIONAL INPUT)  (MATRIX ARRAY OF DIMENSION (IPTB,INDM))
!        ROW I OF THIS ARRAY NORMALLY CONTAINS A POINT USED IN THE ITH
!        CONSTRAINT.  THE ENTRIES IN ROW I NEED NOT BE ASSIGNED VALUES IF
!        SUCH A POINT IS NOT USED IN THE ITH CONSTRAINT.
!        (EXAMPLE:  IF THE LEFT SIDE OF CONSTRAINT I IS A POLYNOMIAL IN
!        ONE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE, THEN THE VALUE OF THE INDEPENDENT
!        VARIABLE SHOULD BE IN PTTBL(I,1), AND THE COEFFICIENTS SHOULD BE
!        IN PARAM.)
!        PTTBL CAN ALSO BE USED TO PASS OTHER INFORMATION FROM THE DRIVER
!        PROGRAM TO SUBROUTINE FNSET.
!
! IPTB   (INPUT)  THIS IS THE FIRST DIMENSION OF PTTBL IN THE DRIVER
!        PROGRAM.  IT MUST BE .GE. THE LARGEST SUBSCRIPT I FOR WHICH A
!        VALUE PTTBL(I,J) IS USED, AND MUST BE .GE. 1 IF NO SUCH VALUES
!        ARE USED.
!
! INDB   (INPUT)  THIS IS THE SECOND DIMENSION OF PTTBL IN THE DRIVER
!        PROGRAM.  IT MUST BE .GE. THE LARGEST SUBSCRIPT J FOR WHICH A
!        VALUE PTTBL(I,J) IS USED, AND MUST BE .GE. 1 IF NO SUCH VALUES
!        ARE USED.
!
! IWORK  (INPUT)  (VECTOR ARRAY OF DIMENSION LIWRK)  THIS IS AN INTEGER
!        WORK ARRAY.  THE USER NEED NOT PLACE ANY VALUES IN IT, EXCEPT
!        POSSIBLY CERTAIN OPTIONAL INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED BELOW.
!
! LIWRK  (INPUT)  THIS IS THE DIMENSION OF IWORK IN THE DRIVER PROGRAM.
!        IT MUST BE AT LEAST 7*NUMGR + 7*NPARM + 3.  IF NOT, CONMAX WILL
!        RETURN WITH THIS MINIMUM VALUE MULTIPLIED BY -1 AS A WARNING.
!
! WORK   (INPUT)  (VECTOR ARRAY OF DIMENSION LWRK)  THIS IS A FLOATING
!        POINT WORK ARRAY.  THE USER NEED NOT PLACE ANY VALUES IN IT,
!        EXCEPT POSSIBLY CERTAIN OPTIONAL INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED BELOW.
!
! LWRK   (INPUT)  THIS IS THE DIMENSION OF WORK IN THE DRIVER PROGRAM.
!        IT MUST BE AT LEAST 2*NPARM**2 + 4*NUMGR*NPARM + 11*NUMGR +
!        27*NPARM + 13.  IF NOT, CONMAX WILL RETURN WITH THIS MINIMUM
!        VALUE MULTIPLIED BY -1 AS A WARNING.
!
! ITER   (OUTPUT)  THIS IS THE NUMBER OF ITERATIONS PERFORMED BY CONMAX,
!        INCLUDING THOSE USED IN ATTEMPTING TO GAIN FEASIBILITY,
!        UNTIL EITHER IT CAN NO LONGER IMPROVE THE SITUATION OR THE
!        ITERATION LIMIT  IS REACHED.  IF ITER=ITLIM IT IS POSSIBLE
!        THAT THE PROGRAM  COULD FURTHER REDUCE W IF RESTARTED
!        (POSSIBLY WITH THE NEW PARAMETERS).  ITER=-1 IS A SIGNAL
!        THAT TYPE -1 FEASIBILITY COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED, IN THIS CASE
!        ERROR WILL CONTAIN THE VALUES COMPUTED USING THE USER
!        SUPPLIED INITIAL APPROXIMATION.  ITER=-2 IS A SIGNAL THAT
!        TYPE -1 FEASIBILITY WAS ACHIEVED BUT TYPE -2 FEASIBILITY
!        COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED, IN THIS CASE VALUES IN ERROR
!        CORRESPONDING TO TYPE 1 OR TYPE 2 CONSTRAINTS WILL BE ZERO.
!
! PARAM  (INPUT AND OUTPUT)  (VECTOR ARRAY OF DIMENSION AT LEAST NPARM
!        IN THE DRIVER PROGRAM)  THE USER SHOULD PLACE AN INITIAL GUESS
!        FOR THE PARAMETERS IN PARAM, AND ON OUTPUT PARAM WILL CONTAIN
!        THE BEST PARAMETERS CONMAX HAS BEEN ABLE TO FIND.  IF THE
!        INITIAL PARAM IS NOT FEASIBLE THE PROGRAM WILL FIRST TRY TO
!        FIND A FEASIBLE PARAM.
!
! ERROR  (OUTPUT)  (VECTOR ARRAY OF DIMENSION AT LEAST NUMGR + 3 IN THE
!        DRIVER PROGRAM)  FOR I=1,...,NUMGR, CONMAX WILL PLACE IN
!        ERROR(I) THE ERROR IN CONSTRAINT I (DEFINED TO BE THE VALUE
!        OF THE LEFT SIDE OF CONSTRAINT I, EXCEPT WITHOUT THE ABSOLUTE
!        VALUE IN TYPE 2 CONSTRAINTS).  FURTHER,
!
!   ERROR(NUMGR+1) WILL BE THE (PRINCIPAL) ERROR NORM, THAT IS, THE
!        MAXIMUM VALUE OF THE LEFT SIDES OF THE TYPE 2 (INCLUDING THE
!        ABSOLUTE VALUE) AND TYPE 1 CONSTRAINTS.
!
!   ERROR(NUMGR+2) WILL BE THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF THE LEFT SIDES OF THE
!        TYPE -1 CONSTRAINTS, OR 0.0 IF THERE ARE NO TYPE -1
!        CONSTRAINTS.  EXCEPT FOR ROUNDOFF ERROR AND SMALL TOLERANCES
!        IN SOME SUBROUTINES THIS VALUE WILL NORMALLY BE .LE. 0.0, AND
!        IT WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE .GT. TOLCON IN THE MAIN PART OF
!        THE PROGRAM.
!
!   ERROR(NUMGR+3) WILL BE THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF THE LEFT SIDES OF THE
!        TYPE -2 CONSTRAINTS, OR 0.0 IF THERE ARE NO TYPE -2
!        CONSTRAINTS.  THIS VALUE SHOULD BE .LE. TOLCON, SINCE THE
!        PROGRAM WILL NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO COMPUTE VALUES FOR THE
!        TYPE 2 AND TYPE 1 CONSTRAINTS OTHERWISE (EXCEPT FOR VALUES
!        CORRESPONDING TO THE INITIAL PARAMETERS PLACED IN PARAM BY
!        THE USER).  THE USER CAN USE THIS FEATURE TO INSERT TYPE -2
!        OR -1 CONSTRAINTS TO KEEP THE PARAMETERS AWAY FROM VALUES
!        WHERE A TYPE 2 OR TYPE 1 CONSTRAINT IS UNDEFINED.
!
! THE USER HAS SEVERAL EXTRA OPTIONS WHICH ARE ACTIVATED BY SETTING
! IOPTN TO A VALUE OTHER THAN 0; MORE THAN ONE AT A TIME CAN BE USED.
! IN PARTICULAR,
!
! IF THE ONES DIGIT OF IOPTN IS 0, THEN THE USER SHOULD GIVE FORMULAS
! IN FNSET FOR COMPUTING THE PARTIAL DERIVATIVES WHEN INDFN=1  AS DESCRIBED
! ABOVE.
!
! IF THE USER SETS THE ONES DIGIT OF IOPTN TO 1, THEN INDFN WILL ALWAYS
! BE 0 WHEN FNSET IS CALLED, AND THE PROGRAM WILL AUTOMATICALLY
! APPROXIMATE THE PARTIAL DERIVATIVES WHEN REQUIRED USING THE FOLLOWING
! CENTERED DIFFERENCE FORMULA:
! PARTIAL DERIVATIVE WITH RESPECT TO THE JTH VARIABLE (WHERE 1 .LE. J
! .LE. NPARM) OF THE FUNCTION WHOSE VALUE IS COMPUTED IN CONFUN(IPT,1)
! (WHERE 1 .LE. IPT .LE. NUMGR) IS APPROXIMATELY THE VALUE OF THIS
! FUNCTION WHEN THE JTH COMPONENT OF PARAM IS INCREASED BY DELT, MINUS
! THE VALUE OF THIS FUNCTION WHEN THE JTH COMPONENT OF PARAM IS
! DECREASED BY DELT, ALL DIVIDED BY 2.0*DELT, WHERE DELT = SQRT(B**(-ITT)),
! WHERE B IS THE BASE FOR FOR FLOATING POINT NUMBERS AND ITT IS THE NUMBER
! OF BASE B DIGITS IN THE MANTISSA.
!
! IF THE TENS DIGIT OF IOPTN IS 0, THE PROGRAM WILL NOT GIVE UP
! UNTIL EITHER AN ITERATION FAILS TO PRODUCE A REDUCTION ABS(ENCHG) OF
! MORE THAN 100.0*B**(-ITT) IN THE PRINCIPAL ERROR NORM, OR ITLIM
! ITERATIONS HAVE BEEN USED.
!
! IF THE TENS DIGIT OF IOPTN IS 1, THE PROGRAM WILL ALSO GIVE UP IF
! ABS(ENCHG) .LT. ENCSM FOR LIMSM CONSECUTIVE STEPS IN THE MAIN PART OF
! THE PROGRAM (I.E. AFTER TYPE -1 AND TYPE -2 FEASIBILITY HAVE BOTH BEEN
! ACHIEVED).  THIS OPTION MAY BE USEFUL IN SAVING SOME TIME BY
! FORESTALLING A LONG STRING OF ITERATIONS AT THE END OF A RUN WITH ONLY
! A TINY IMPROVEMENT IN EACH ONE.  ENCSM AND LIMSM ARE TRANSMITTED TO
! CONMAX IN WORK(1) AND IWORK(1) RESPECTIVELY.  WORK(1) AND IWORK(1) DO
! NOT NEED TO BE ASSIGNED VALUES IF THE TENS DIGIT OF IOPTN IS 0.
!
! IF THE HUNDREDS DIGIT OF IOPTN IS 0 OR 2, THEN THE INTERNAL PARAMETER
! NSTEP WILL BE GIVEN THE DEFAULT VALUE 1.  NSTEP IS THE NUMBER OF
! RUNGE-KUTTA STEPS USED IN EACH RK ITERATION.
!
! IF THE HUNDREDS DIGIT OF IOPTN IS 1 OR 3, THEN THE VALUE OF NSTEP USED
! WILL BE THE POSITIVE INTEGER VALUE PLACED IN IWORK(2) BY THE USER IN THE
! DRIVER PROGRAM.  SETTING NSTEP LARGER THAN 1 MAY ALLOW THE PROGRAM TO
! SUCCEED ON DIFFICULT PROBLEMS WHERE THE CONVERGENCE WOULD BE EXTREMELY
! SLOW WITH NSTEP=1, BUT IT WILL GENERALLY CAUSE MORE COMPUTER TIME TO BE
! USED IN EACH RK ITERATION.  IWORK(2) DOES NOT NEED TO BE ASSIGNED A
! VALUE IF THE HUNDREDS DIGIT OF IOPTN IS 0 OR 2.  (NSTEP IS SOMETIMES
! CALLED THE OVERDRIVE PARAMETER.)
!
! IF THE HUNDREDS DIGIT OF IOPTN IS 0 OR 1, THEN THE INTERNAL PARAMETER
! TOLCON WILL BE GIVEN THE DEFAULT VALUE SQRT(B**(-ITT)), WHERE B IS THE
! BASE FOR FLOATING POINT NUMBERS AND ITT IS THE NUMBER OF BASE B DIGITS
! IN THE MANTISSA.
!
! IF THE HUNDREDS DIGIT OF IOPTN IS 2 OR 3, THEN THE VALUE OF TOLCON USED
! WILL BE THE VALUE PLACED IN WORK(2) BY THE USER IN THE DRIVER PROGRAM.
! THIS VALUE SHOULD ALWAYS BE NONNEGATIVE.  IF THERE ARE NO TYPE -2 OR -1
! CONSTRAINTS THEN THE SETTING OF TOLCON WILL HAVE NO EFFECT, BUT IF
! THERE ARE TYPE -2 OR -1 CONSTRAINTS THEN IN GENERAL SMALLER VALUES OF
! TOLCON MAY GIVE MORE ACCURACY IN THE FINAL ANSWER, BUT MAY SLOW DOWN
! OR PREVENT CONVERGENCE, WHILE LARGER VALUES OF TOLCON MAY HAVE THE
! REVERSE EFFECT.  IN PARTICULAR, IF THE TYPE -2 AND -1 CONSTRAINTS
! CANNOT BE SATISFIED SUMULTANEOUSLY WITH STRICT INEQUALITY (THIS CASE
! COULD OCCUR, FOR EXAMPLE, IF AN EQUALITY CONSTRAINT G = 0.0 WAS
! ENTERED AS THE TWO INEQUALITY CONSTRAINTS G .LE. 0.0 AND
! -G .LE. 0.0), THEN SETTING TOLCON=0.0 WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY CAUSE THE
! PROGRAM TO FAIL, SINCE AT EACH ITERATION THE PROGRAM WILL NOT ACCEPT
! PROSPECTIVE NEW VALUES OF THE PARAMETERS UNLESS IT CAN CORRECT THEM
! BACK INTO THE RELAXED FEASIBLE REGION WHERE CONFUN(IPT,1) .LE. TOLCON
! FOR ALL THE TYPE -2 AND -1 CONSTRAINTS.
!
! IF THE THOUSANDS DIGIT OF IOPTN IS 0, THE PROGRAM WILL USE THE RK METHOD
! (WHICH INVOLVES APPLYING FOURTH ORDER RUNGE-KUTTA TO A SYSTEM OF
! DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS), THEN IF THIS FAILS IT WILL TRY TO REDUCE
! W WITH AN SLP STEP (I.E. SUCCESSIVE LINEAR PROGRAMMING WITH A TRUST
! REGION), THEN GO BACK TO RK IF THE SLP STEP REDUCES W.
!
! IF THE THOUSANDS DIGIT OF IOPTN IS 1, THE PROGRAM WILL USE SLP STEPS ONLY.
! IN GENERAL, IN SOME PROBLEMS SLP WORKS VERY WELL, AND IN THOSE
! PROBLEMS IT WILL USUALLY BE FASTER THAN RK BECAUSE IT REQUIRES FEWER
! GRADIENT EVALUATIONS THAN RK, BUT IN OTHER PROBLEMS THE CONVERGENCE
! OF SLP MAY BE EXCRUCIATINGLY SLOW, AND THE MORE POWERFUL RK METHOD
! MAY BE MUCH FASTER.
!
! IF THE THOUSANDS DIGIT OF IOPTN IS 2 THE PROGRAM WILL USE THE RK METHOD
! ONLY, QUITTING WHEN RK CAN NO LONGER PRODUCE AN IMPROVEMENT.  THIS
! MAY GIVE A LITTLE LESS ACCURACY THAN SETTING THE THOUSANDS DIGIT TO 0,
! BUT MAY SAVE SIGNIFICANT COMPUTER TIME IN SOME CASES.
!
! IF THE TEN THOUSANDS DIGIT OF IOPTN IS 0, THEN FNSET SHOULD BE WRITTEN AS
! DESCRIBED ABOVE.
!
! IF THE USER SETS THE TEN THOUSANDS DIGIT OF IOPTN TO 1, THEN FNSET SHOULD BE
! WRITTEN AS DESCRIBED ABOVE EXCEPT THAT THE COMPUTATIONS SHOULD BE DONE
! FOR ALL IPT=1,..,NUMGR INSTEAD OF FOR A SINGLE GIVEN VALUE OF IPT.
! THIS OPTION MAY SAVE COMPUTER TIME IN PROBLEMS WHERE A LARGE PART OF
! THE COMPUTATION IS THE SAME FOR DIFFERENT VALUES OF IPT, SINCE IT
! AVOIDS UNNECESSARY REPITITION OF THIS COMMON COMPUTATION BY HAVING
! THE LOOP OVER IPT IN FNSET INSTEAD OF OUTSIDE FNSET.
! IF THE TEN THOUSANDS DIGIT OF IOPTN IS 1, EVEN MORE TIME CAN OFTEN BE
! SAVED IF FNSET IS WRITTEN SO THAT ALL CONSTRAINTS ARE COMPUTED IF IPT=0,
! BUT ONLY THE STANDARD (I.E. TYPE -1 OR -2) CONSTRAINTS ARE COMPUTED IF
! IPT=-1.  NOTE THAT IF THE TEN THOUSANDS DIGIT OF IOPTN IS 0, THEN IPT
! WILL BE POSITIVE WHENEVER FNSET IS CALLED, INDICATING THAT ONLY
! CONSTRAINT IPT SHOULD BE COMPUTED.
! THE DRAWBACK OF USING THIS OPTION IS THAT IN GENERAL SOME CONSTRAINT
! VALUES AND DERIVATIVES WILL BE COMPUTED UNNECESSARILY, WHICH COULD COST
! TIME IN SOME PROBLEMS.
!
! IF THE COMPILER USED FOR THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT ACCEPT VARIABLE
! DIMENSIONING AS USED HERE, ONE CAN  (1)  CHANGE ALL THE DIMENSIONS TO
! THE APPROPRIATE INTEGER CONSTANTS, WHERE IN THE DIMENSION STATEMENTS
! NPARM AND NUMGR CAN BE CONSISTENTLY REPLACED BY FIXED INTEGERS OF
! EQUAL OR GREATER VALUE, (2)  FOR EACH SUBPROGRAM EXCEPT FNSET, DELETE
! ALL ARRAY NAMES FROM THE ARGUMENT LISTS IN THE SUBROUTINE OR FUNCTION
! STATEMENT EXCEPT FUN, PTTBL, PARAM, ERROR, IWORK, AND WORK, AND DELETE
! THE CORRESPONDING ELEMENTS IN ALL CALL STATEMENTS AND FUNCTION
! SUBPROGRAM REFERENCES, AND (3)  USE AN EQUIVALENCE STATEMENT AFTER
! THE DIMENSION STATEMENT IN EACH SUBPROGRAM WITH ARRAYS DELETED FROM
! THE ARGUMENT LIST TO ASSOCIATE THE FIRST ELEMENT OF EACH DELETED
! ARRAY WITH THE APPROPRIATE ELEMENT IN IWORK OR WORK USING THE
! INFORMATION IN FUNCTION SUBPROGRAM ILOC.
!
! FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE ALGORITHM AND PROGRAM, SEE THE PAPER
!
! AN ODE-BASED APPROACH TO NONLINEARLY CONSTRAINED MINIMAX PROBLEMS, BY
! E. H. KAUFMAN, JR., D. J. LEEMING, AND G. D. TAYLOR, NUMERICAL
! ALGORITHMS (1995), PP. 25-37.
!
! NOTE THAT SINCE THAT PAPER WAS WRITTEN, TOLCON WAS DELETED FROM THE
! ARGUMENT LIST OF CONMAX.

! THIS PROGRAM WAS DEVELOPED BY ED KAUFMAN, DAVID LEEMING, AND JERRY
! TAYLOR.  THE METHOD USED IS AN ENHANCED VERSION OF THE METHOD DESCRIBED
! IN (WOLFE, PHILIP, FINDING THE NEAREST POINT IN A POLYTOPE, MATHEMATICAL
! PROGRAMMING 11 (1976), 128-149).
!
!***THE NEXT GROUP OF COMMENTS IS FOR THE CASE WHERE THE USER WISHES TO
! RUN WOLFE BY ITSELF RATHER THAN AS A PART OF CONMAX.
!
! TO RUN THE PROGRAM, WRITE A DRIVER
! PROGRAM WHICH DIMENSIONS THE ARRAYS IN THE CALLING SEQUENCE FOR WOLFE
! AND SETS THE INPUT VARIABLES AS SPECIFIED IN THE LIST BELOW, THEN CALL
! SUBROUTINE WOLFE.
!
! THE VARIABLES, IN THE ORDER OF THEIR APPEARANCE IN THE ARGUMENT LIST OF
! SUBROUTINE WOLFE, ARE AS FOLLOWS.
!
! NDM  (INPUT)  THIS IS THE NUMBER OF VARIABLES.  IT MUST BE LESS THAN OR
!    EQUAL TO NPARM.
!
! M  (INPUT)  THIS IS THE NUMBER OF INEQUALITIES DEFINING THE POLYTOPE.  IT
!    MUST BE LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO NUMGR.
!
! PMAT  (INPUT)  THIS IS AN ARRAY WHOSE KTH COLUMN CONTAINS THE VECTOR
!    (A(K),B(K)) FOR K=1,...,M, WHERE THE M INEQUALITIES A(K).X + B(K)
!    .LE. 0.0 DEFINE THE POLYTOPE WHOSE NEAREST POINT TO THE ORIGIN WE
!    SEEK.  THE FIRST DIMENSION OF PMAT IN THE DRIVER PROGRAM MUST BE
!    EXACTLY NPARM+1, WHILE THE SECOND DIMENSION OF PMAT IN THE DRIVER
!    PROGRAM MUST BE AT LEAST NUMGR.
!    IF WE ACTUALLY WANT THE NEAREST POINT IN THE POLYTOPE TO SOME POINT
!    Y OTHER THAN THE ORIGIN, WE TRANSLATE Y TO THE ORIGIN BEFORE CALLING
!    WOLFE, THAT IS, CALL WOLFE TO FIND THE NEAREST POINT Z TO THE ORIGIN
!    IN THE POLYTOPE DEFINED BY A(K).Z + (B(K) + A(K).Y) .LE. 0.0, THEN
!    COMPUTE X = Y + Z.
!
! ISTRT  (INPUT)  SET THIS EQUAL TO ZERO UNLESS A HOT START IS DESIRED--
!    SEE NEXT PARAGRAPH OF COMMENTS FOR MORE DETAILS.  IF ISTRT IS SET
!    EQUAL TO 1, THEN S, WCOEF, NCOR, AND ICOR MUST ALSO BE ASSIGNED
!    VALUES INITIALLY.
!
! S  (OUTPUT)  YOU MAY IGNORE THIS SCALE FACTOR UNLESS YOU WANT TO USE
!    THE HOT START OPTION.
!
! NCOR  (OUTPUT)  THIS IS THE NUMBER OF VECTORS (I.E. COLUNNS OF PMAT) IN
!    THE FINAL CORRAL.
!
! ICOR  (OUTPUT)  THIS ARRAY CONTAINS THE NCOR INDICES OF THE VECTORS IN
!    THE FINAL CORRAL.  ITS DIMENSION IN THE DRIVER PROGRAM MUST BE AT
!    LEAST NPARM+1.
!
! IWORK  (WORK ARRAY)  ITS DIMENSION IN THE DRIVER PROGRAM MUST BE LIWRK.
!
! LIWRK  (INPUT)  THIS IS THE DIMENSION OF IWORK.  IT MUST BE AT LEAST
!    7*NPARM + 7*NUMGR + 3.
!
! WORK  (WORK ARRAY)  ITS DIMENSION IN THE DRIVER PROGRAM MUST BE LWRK.
!
! LWRK  (INPUT)  THIS IS THE DIMENSION OF WORK.  IT MUST BE AT LEAST
!    2*NPARM**2 + 4*NUMGR*NPARM + 11*NUMGR + 27*NPARM + 13.
!    NOTE THAT SOME STORAGE COULD BE SAVED BY REWRITING FUNCTION
!    SUBPROGRAM ILOC TO TAKE OUT ALL BUT THE ARRAYS NEEDED (NAMELY 1, 3,
!    4, 9, 28, 32, 34, 39 FOR WORK, 18, 23 FOR IWORK) AND SCRUNCHING
!    WORK AND IWORK IN ILOC SO THE REMAINING ARRAYS FOLLOW ONE AFTER
!    ANOTHER.
!
! R  (WORK ARRAY)  ITS DIMENSION IN THE DRIVER PROGRAM MUST BE AT LEAST
!    NPARM+1.
!
! COEF  (WORK ARRAY)  ITS DIMENSION IN THE DRIVER PROGRAM MUST BE AT LEAST
!    NUMGR.
!
! PTNR  (WORK ARRAY)  ITS DIMENSION IN THE DRIVER PROGRAM MUST BE AT LEAST
!    NPARM+1.
!
! PMAT1  (WORK ARRAY)  ITS DIMENSION IN THE DRIVER PROGRAM SHOULD BE THE
!    SAME AS THE DIMENSION OF PMAT.
!
! NPARM  (INPUT)  THIS IS BASICALLY A DIMENSION PARAMETER HERE.  IT MUST
!    BE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO NDM.
!
! NUMGR  (INPUT)  THIS IS BASICALLY A DIMENSION PARAMETER HERE.  IT MUST
!    BE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO M.
!
! WCOEF  (OUTPUT)  THIS WILL GIVE THE COEFFICIENTS OF THE VECTORS A(K)
!    NEEDED TO FORM A LINEAR COMBINATION EQUAL TO THE SOLUTION IN WPT.
!    ITS DIMENSION IN THE DRIVER PROGRAM MUST BE AT LEAST NUMGR.
!    WCOEF MAY NOT BE ACCURATE IF IT WAS NECESSARY TO CALL REFWL TO
!    REFINE WPT, WHICH RARELY HAPPENS.
!
! WPT  (OUTPUT)  THIS WILL GIVE THE COORDINATES OF THE POINT WE ARE SEEKING,
!    NAMELY THE NEAREST POINT IN THE POLYTOPE TO THE ORIGIN.  ITS DIMENSION
!    IN THE DRIVER PROGRAM MUST BE AT LEAST NPARM.
!
! WDIST  (OUTPUT)  THIS WILL BE THE (MINIMIZED) EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE OF WPT
!    FROM THE ORIGIN.
!
! NMAJ  (OUTPUT)  THIS WILL BE THE NUMBER OF MAJOR CYCLES USED IN WOLFE.
!
! NMIN  (OUTPUT)  THIS WILL BE THE NUMBER OF MINOR CYCLES USED IN WOLFE.
!
! JFLAG  (OUTPUT)  THIS IS A FLAG VARIABLE WHICH IS 0 IN CASE OF A NORMAL
!    SOLUTION AND IS POSITIVE OTHERWISE (IN WHICH CASE THE RETURNED
!    SOLUTION MAY BE NO GOOD).
!
!***END OF COMMENTS FOR RUNNING WOLFE BY ITSELF RATHER THAN AS A PART OF
! CONMAX.
!
! GIVEN M INEQUALITIES OF THE FORM A(K).X + B(K) .LE. 0.0 FOR K=1,
! ...,M, WHERE A(K) AND X ARE NDM DIMENSIONAL VECTORS AND B(K)
! ARE NUMBERS, THIS SUBROUTINE RETURNS THE NEAREST POINT TO THE
! ORIGIN IN THE POLYTOPE DEFINED BY THESE INEQUALITIES (UNLESS
! JFLAG .GT. 0, WHICH INDICATES FAILURE).  THE USER SHOULD PUT
! THE MDM+1 DIMENSIONAL VECTORS (A(K),B(K)) IN THE COLUMNS OF PMAT.
! THE SOLUTION POINT WILL BE RETURNED IN WPT, AND WILL ALSO BE A
! LINEAR COMBINATION OF THE A(K) VECTORS WITH (NONPOSITIVE)
! COEFFICIENTS IN THE M DIMENSIONAL VECTOR WCOEF.  WCOEF MAY NOT BE
! ACCURATE IF REFWL WAS USED TO REFINE WPT, WHICH RARELY HAPPENS. THE
! NUMBER OF VECTORS IN THE FINAL CORRAL WILL BE RETURNED IN NCOR WITH
! THEIR INDICES IN ICOR, AND ALL ENTRIES OF WCOEF NOT CORRESPONDING TO
! INDICES IN ICOR WILL BE ZERO.  THE DISTANCE WILL BE RETURNED IN
! WDIST, AND THE NUMBERS OF MAJOR AND MINOR CYCLES IN THE CONE
! SUBPROBLEM WILL BE RETURNED IN NMAJ AND NMIN RESPECTIVELY.
! IF THE USER SETS ISTRT=0 THE PROGRAM WILL START FROM SCRATCH, BUT
! THE USER CAN SET ISTRT=1 (HOT START) AND SPECIFY NCOR, ICOR, WCOEF,
! AND THE FACTOR S.  (SEE LATER COMMENTS; SET S=1.0 IF NO BETTER VALUE IS
! AVAILABLE.  SET WCOEF(J)=0.0 IF ICOR(I) .NE. J FOR I=1,...,NCOR.)  (IF
! INACCURATE WCOEF OR S IS USED IN A HOT START ATTEMPT LITTLE WILL BE
! LOST, SINCE NCOR AND ICOR ARE MORE IMPORTANT FOR A SUCCESSFUL HOT START
! THAN WCOEF AND S.)  WE MUST ALWAYS HAVE NCOR .LE. NDM+1 IN THEORY SINCE
! THE NCOR NDM+1 DIMENSIONAL VECTORS IN A CORRAL SHOULD BE LINEARLY
! INDEPENDENT, AND IN PRACTICE WE WILL ALWAYS REQUIRE NCOR .LE. NDM+1.
! IF THE USER SETS ISTRT=1 BUT THE PROGRAM FAILS, IT WILL
! AUTOMATICALLY TRY FROM SCRATCH BEFORE GIVING UP.
