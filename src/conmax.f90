!  Module for CONMAX.
!
!### Notes
!  * We note here that the only active write statements in this package
!   are in the sample driver program, but some of those which have been
!   commented out (along with the statements  nwrit=output_unit) elsewhere
!   in the program could prove useful, especially the statement
!   write(nwrit,1100)... in subroutine conmax.)
!

!    "An ODE-based approach to nonlinearly constrained minimax problems",

!### History
!  * CONMAX, Version 1.7. This package was last revised on December 4, 1996.
!    from: http://www.netlib.org/opt/conmax.f
!  * Jacob Williams, August 2021 : Refactored into modern Fortran.

! CONMAX consists of two programs for solving the problem
!
!```
!     minimize w
!
!     subject to
!
!     abs(fun(i) - confun(i,1)) <= w      if icntyp(i)=2,
!
!     confun(i,1)               <= w      if icntyp(i)=1,
!
!     confun(i,1)               <= 0.0    if icntyp(i)=-1 or -2,
!```
!
! Where:
!
!  * if `icntyp(i)=-1` the constraint is linear (i.e. the left side
!    consists of a linear combination of the parameters in the vector array
!    param plus a constant)
!  * if `icntyp(i)=-2` the constraint may be nonlinear.
!
! Thus we are choosing the parameters to minimize the left sides of
! the type 2 and type 1 (i.e. primary) constraints subject to the
! type -1 and type -2 (i.e. standard) constraints.
!
! If there are no primary constraints the program will attempt to
! find a feasible point (that is, a vector param for which the type -1
! and type -2 constraints are satisfied within a tolerance tolcon
! described below) which is relatively close to the user supplied initial
! approximation, then return.
!
!### Notes
!  * Since `iwork` and `work` are changed by the program,
!    the user will need to reset these values each time conmax is called.

!  This subroutine uses a modified quadratic fitting process to search
!  for a projection factor procor for which the maximum of the left
!  sides of the type -2 and -1 constraints evaluated at zwork + procor*dvec
!  is <= tolcon.  note that when corrct calls this subroutine it will
!  have lumped the type -1 constraints in with the type -2 constraints
!  using jcntyp, which is carried through this subroutine into subroutine
!  ercmp1 in iwork.  if searcr is able to force this maximum <= tolcon
!  it will return with isrcr=0, with the minimum value found for the
!  maximum in emin, with the corresponding projection factor in procor,
!  with the number of times the maximum was computed in nsrch, and with the
!  closest point found to the left with the maximum > tolcon in (p1,f1).
!  the subroutine will begin by computing the maxima for procor = 1.0,
!  0.5, and 2.0, and if none of these maxima is <= tolcon and it is
!  not the case that the maximum at 1.0 is <= the other two maxima
!  the subroutine will return with the warning isrcr=1. the subroutine
!  will also return with isrcr=1 if it would need to compute f more than
!  limscr times, or the search interval length drops below tol1, or the
!  quadratic fit becomes too flat.  even in the event of a return with
!  isrcr=1, emin, procor, and nsrch will be as above.

!  given m inequalities of the form a(k).x + b(k) <= 0.0 for k=1,

!  are numbers, this subroutine returns the nearest point to the
!  origin in the polytope defined by these inequalities (unless
!  jflag > 0, which indicates failure).  the user should put
!  the mdm+1 dimensional vectors (a(k),b(k)) in the columns of pmat.
!  the solution point will be returned in wpt, and will also be a
!  linear combination of the a(k) vectors with (nonpositive)
!  coefficients in the m dimensional vector wcoef.  wcoef may not be
!  accurate if refwl was used to refine wpt, which rarely happens. the
!  number of vectors in the final corral will be returned in ncor with
!  their indices in icor, and all entries of wcoef not corresponding to
!  indices in icor will be zero.  the distance will be returned in
!  wdist, and the numbers of major and minor cycles in the cone
!  subproblem will be returned in nmaj and nmin respectively.
!  if the user sets istrt=0 the program will start from scratch, but
!  the user can set istrt=1 (hot start) and specify ncor, icor, wcoef,
!  and the factor s.  (see later comments; set s=1.0 if no better value is
!  available.  set wcoef(j)=0.0 if icor(i) /= j for i=1,...,ncor.)  (if
!  inaccurate wcoef or s is used in a hot start attempt little will be
!  lost, since ncor and icor are more important for a successful hot start
!  than wcoef and s.)  we must always have ncor <= ndm+1 in theory since
!  the ncor ndm+1 dimensional vectors in a corral should be linearly
!  independent, and in practice we will always require ncor <= ndm+1.
!  if the user sets istrt=1 but the program fails, it will
!  automatically try from scratch before giving up.

!  programming 11 (1976), 128-149).

!  Given m n-dimensional vectors p(j) as the first m columns
!  of the matrix pmat1 and an n-vector r, this subroutine returns in
!  ptnr the nearest point to r in the cone of points summation(
!  coef(j)*p(j)), where coef(j) >= 0.0 for j=1,...,m (unless jflag > 0,
!  which indicates failure).  the number of vectors p(j) in
!  the final corral is returned in ncor with their indices in icor,
!  the distance is returned in dist, the number of major cycles (i.e.
!  adding a vector) is returned in nmaj, and the number of minor cycles
!  (i.e. removing a vector) is returned in nmin.  if the user sets
!  istrt1=0 the subroutne starts from scratch, but the user can set
!  istrt1=1 and initially specify ncor, icor, and coef (noting that ncor
!  must be <= n, and if j does not occur in icor, then coef(j) should
!  be set to 0.0.)
