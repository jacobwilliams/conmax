! (B) ONE-DIMENSIONAL DERIVATIVE-FREE QUADRATIC SEARCH FOR A POSITIVE
!     LOCAL MINIMUM
!
! (SUBPROGRAMS INVOLVED:  SEARSL, FNSET (USER SUPPLIED), ILOC,
! ERCMP1, RCHMOD, CORRCT, SEARCR, MULLER, WOLFE, CONENR, HOUSE,
! DOTPRD, REFWL;  ONLY THE FIRST FIVE OF THESE ARE ACTUALLY USED)
!
! GIVEN A FUNCTION F OF ONE VARIABLE (WHERE F(X) IS COMPUTED IN SUBROUTINE
! FNSET AS CONFUN(1,1), WITH X = PARAM(1)) AND A POSITIVE NUMBER PROJCT,
! THE PROGRAM WILL ATTEMPT TO LOCATE A NEW PROJCT WITH EMIN = F(PROJCT),
! WITH THE NEW PROJCT APPROXIMATELY GIVING A LOCAL MINIMUM OF F IN
! [(OLD PROJCT)/1024, 1024*(OLD PROJCT)].  IF IT FAILS TO DO THIS, THE
! PROGRAM WILL RETURN WITH PROJCT = THE ABSCISSA FOUND WITH SMALLEST
! EMIN = F(PROJCT).  ON OUTPUT, NSRCH WILL BE THE NUMBER OF EVALUATIONS
! OF F THAT WERE DONE.  THE SOLUTION PROCEDURE IS A MODIFICATION OF THE
! FOLLOWING:  COMPUTE F(PROJCT/2), F(PROJCT), AND F(2*PROJCT), IF THE
! CONDITIONS F(MIDDLE POINT) .LE. F(LEFT POINT) AND F(MIDDLE POINT) .LE.
! F(RIGHT POINT) ARE NOT BOTH SATISFIED THEN TRY TO GET THIS BY COMPUTING
! F AT SMALLER (OR LARGER) POINTS AT MOST 3 MORE TIMES;  ONCE THE
! CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED, ASSUMING THE POINTS ARE NOT TOO CLOSE TO BEING
! COLLINEAR, PASS A QUADRATIC POLYNOMIAL THROUGH THE THREE POINTS AND USE
! ITS UNIQUE MINIMUM IN THE INTERVAL TO REPLACE ONE OF THE ENDPOINTS WHILE
! MAINTAINING THE TWO CONDITIONS, CONTINUING UNTIL F HAS BEEN COMPUTED 4
! MORE TIMES OR THE INTERVAL LENGTH FALLS BELOW 100.0*B**(-ITT) OR THE
! POINTS BECOME NEARLY COLLINEAR.  THE FOLLOWING SAMPLE DRIVER AND
! SUBROUTINE FNSET ARE SET UP TO APPROXIMATE A SOLUTION OF THE LINE SEARCH
! PROBLEM OF MINIMIZING G((6.0D0,2.0D0) + PROJCT*(-2.0D0,-1.0D0)), WHERE
! G(U,V) = 3.0D0*ABS(U) + 2.0D0*ABS(V).  WE START WITH PROJCT = 1.0D0,
! THEN RUN THE PROGRAM AGAIN STARTING WITH THE RESULT OF THE FIRST RUN.
! (THE EXACT SOLUTION IS PROJCT = 3.0D0, EMIN = 2.0D0;  CONVERGENCE IS
! RATHER SLOW, MAINLY BECAUSE F IS NOT DIFFERENTIABLE AT THE MINIMUM.)
